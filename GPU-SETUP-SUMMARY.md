# GPU Development Environment Setup Summary

## What Has Been Created

I've successfully created a complete GPU development environment for your GMP Featurizer project. Here's what's been set up:

### 1. **Dockerfile.gpu**
- Based on NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 development image
- Includes all necessary build tools and dependencies
- Installs GEMMI and nlohmann/json libraries
- Sets up proper CUDA environment variables
- Creates a non-root user for development

### 2. **docker-compose.gpu.yml**
- Easy-to-use Docker Compose configuration
- Properly configures GPU access with NVIDIA runtime
- Mounts your source code for live development
- Sets up volume mounts for git config and SSH keys

### 3. **Updated CMakeLists.txt**
- Added CUDA support with conditional compilation
- Supports both CPU and GPU builds
- Automatically detects CUDA installation
- Sets up proper include directories and linking
- Defines `GMP_ENABLE_CUDA` macro for conditional code
- **Integrated CUDA test** into the test suite (only built when CUDA enabled)

### 4. **build.sh**
- **Single build script** for the main project
- Supports both CPU and GPU builds with validation
- Maintains compatibility with existing build options
- Provides clear error messages and usage instructions
- Colored output for better user experience

### 5. **test/test-cuda.cu**
- CUDA test program integrated into the test suite
- Uses Google Test framework for comprehensive testing
- Tests CUDA device detection and Thrust operations
- Only built and run when CUDA is enabled
- Provides immediate feedback on GPU environment setup

### 6. **Documentation**
- `README-GPU.md`: Comprehensive guide for the GPU environment
- `GPU-SETUP-SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Key Features

### ✅ **Full Backward Compatibility**
- Your existing CPU code will continue to work unchanged
- Build scripts support both CPU and GPU modes
- Conditional compilation ensures CPU fallback when GPU is not available

### ✅ **CUDA 12.4 + Thrust Support**
- Latest stable CUDA version with full development tools
- Thrust library for high-level GPU programming
- Support for multiple GPU architectures (60, 70, 75, 80, 86)

### ✅ **Simplified Build System**
- **Single build script** for the main project
- Consistent interface across all build types
- Automatic CUDA detection and validation
- Colored output for better user experience

### ✅ **Integrated Testing**
- CUDA test integrated into the main test suite
- Uses Google Test framework for comprehensive testing
- Only built when CUDA is enabled
- Runs with other tests using standard CMake test infrastructure

### ✅ **Easy Development Workflow**
- Docker-based environment for consistent development
- Live code mounting for immediate testing
- Standard CMake test infrastructure

### ✅ **Production Ready**
- Proper error handling and validation
- Performance optimization flags
- Debug and release build configurations

## How to Use

### 1. **Build the GPU Container**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml build
```

### 2. **Start Development**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml exec gmp-featurizer-gpu bash
```

### 3. **Test the Environment**
```bash
# Build with GPU support
./build.sh single gpu

# Run all tests (including CUDA test)
cd build-gpu && make run_all_tests
```

### 4. **Build Your Code**
```bash
# CPU-only builds
./build.sh                    # Single precision CPU (default)
./build.sh single cpu         # Single precision CPU
./build.sh double cpu         # Double precision CPU

# GPU-enabled builds
./build.sh single gpu         # Single precision GPU
./build.sh double gpu         # Double precision GPU
```

### 5. **Add GPU Code**
- Create `.cu` files for CUDA kernels
- Use `#ifdef GMP_ENABLE_CUDA` for conditional compilation
- Include Thrust headers for high-level GPU programming

## Build Script Usage

The `build.sh` script accepts two parameters:
1. **Floating-point precision**: `single` (default), `double`, `float`
2. **Build type**: `cpu` (default), `gpu`

Examples:
```bash
./build.sh                    # Single precision, CPU only
./build.sh double             # Double precision, CPU only
./build.sh single gpu         # Single precision, GPU enabled
./build.sh double gpu         # Double precision, GPU enabled
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the environment** by building with GPU support
2. **Build your existing code** to ensure compatibility
3. **Add GPU kernels** to your source files using conditional compilation
4. **Profile and optimize** your GPU code for maximum performance

## Support

- Check `README-GPU.md` for detailed documentation
- Build with GPU support to diagnose issues
- Use conditional compilation for GPU code integration

The environment is now ready for GPU development while maintaining full compatibility with your existing CPU codebase!
